api-gateway-v2-to-wsgi
======================

translation from the aws api gateway v2.0 lambda event to wsgi

## installation

`pip install api-gateway-v2-to-wsgi`

## usage

```python
import api_gateway_v2_to_wsgi

from ... import app

# app is your wsgi callable, such as the `Flask(...)` object from `flask`
lambda_handler = api_gateway_v2_to_wsgi.make_lambda_handler(app)
```

## sample application

for a full sample, see [testing/example](testing/example)

## more information

for more information on how I set up my lambda, see
[testing/example.md](testing/example.md).

additionally, see the [api gateway documentation] (though it's not very good
at the time of writing so glhf)

seems the [lambda integration guide] is slightly better
